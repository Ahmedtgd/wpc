In this\u00a0article we\u00a0will help you get a better understanding of both options, the\u00a0particularly outsourcing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In-house development vs. outsourcing mobile app development services<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>In-house Development Team<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An in-house development team provides several distinct advantages, from having\u00a0\u00a0Y our own team\u00a0that understands your business thoroughly and out, with all of its quirks, and up to\u00a0having a\u00a0complete control over the app development process since the team will be working right in your office.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are certain disadvantages to consider.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The total cost of ownership (TCO) for a mobile app built using your\u00a0in-house team is quite high\u00a0since you&#8217;ll need to hire experienced developers, provide them with office space and equipment, and pay all other expenditures connected with in-house team.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Another disadvantage\u00a0to consider is that your new in-house development team will most probably have limited knowledge and experience with your business domain, which will result in additional cost of training and time\u00a0until they are fully acquainted with your business domain,\u00a0business process,..etc.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We must not overlook the importance of\u00a0a business analyst to analyse your business requirements, convert them I coordination with the team lead into deliverable tasks your in-house developers can deliver. Also an infosec expert will be required to ensure\u00a0the security of your app including most important\u00a0your customers&#8217; information who will be using your\u00a0app.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you need to carefully study if you will need the whole team after releasing your app or you will need to reduce the maintenance team size.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Even if the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, an in-house team is unquestionably the best option when you have a large mobile application project, such as Whatsapp, Alibaba or Booking.com, which will undoubtedly need a big team in-house team for development and maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Outsourcing mobile app development choices:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There are three choices for outsourcing mobile app development, and we will explore each of them in detail, including the advantages and disadvantages of each:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mobile app development tools<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re building a small app, short on time and money\u00a0and don&#8217;t need anything unique in term of UI\/UX and features then you might consider\u00a0mobile app development tools like Xamarin, Appcelerator,&#8230;etc. One of the major\u00a0advantages of those tools\u00a0is their overall cost, which will help\u00a0you get your mobile app in front of your clients quickly at the lowest budget possible.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>However, you should also study\u00a0the disadvantages of those tools, to see if they weigh higher when making your decision. By\u00a0using mobile app development tools,\u00a0 it will be quite challenging to scale your mobile app in the future or to move your app from those tools to another technology stack, which might result in getting you to rebuild your app again from scratch on another technology stack in the future.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to UI\/UX, mobile app development tools, have some great UI\/UX to offer for your app, yet that won&#8217;t be unique as many others using the same tool have used the same UI before.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Independent mobile app developers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>Outsourcing your mobile\u00a0app development to independent developers on various freelancing platforms is another viable option for a simple app.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Freelancers are\u00a0usually specialized in one or two niches\u00a0in which they excel. If the features you want are within the app developer&#8217;s area of expertise, you could save a lot of money. Some freelancers also collaborate with others, forming teams similar to those seen at outsourcing firms. You may not need to look for separate developers, designers, and QA professionals in this situation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One disadvantage of hiring freelancers to complete your next mobile application project is that there is little you can do to prevent the freelancers from dropping the ball mid-project. The damage associated with such risk does not end at hiring a new freelancer or the time wasted in finding another freelancer with an experience in your business domain, as the\u00a0next selected\u00a0freelancer will\u00a0have\u00a0learning curve to understand the previous freelancer&#8217;s source code before resuming your project which will come at an extra cost.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mobile app development companies<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When you have an unique idea, business process, or a medium-large\u00a0mobile application and time is of importance, it is best to outsource your mobile application project to a company with expertise in your business\u00a0domain. Android,\u00a0iOS developers, UI\/UX designers, testers, project managers, and business analysts are all available via bespoke mobile application development companies. When building a mobile application from scratch, a complete team is unquestionably the best option.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, you can ensure the security of your mobile application idea with a legally binding agreement, establish penalties for late deliveries, and have a single point of contact to track the development of your project without having to worry about training, absence, leave, dropping the ball..etc.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The actual disadvantage of engaging with\u00a0bespoke mobile app development companies is their cost, which is obviously more than that of independant contractors\u00a0and mobile app development tools.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of option you select, you need to carefully consider each alternative before continuing to prevent increasing the total cost of ownership for your mobile application or, worse, endangering the security of your mobile application concept or corporate secrets.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Once you&#8217;ve decided to develop a mobile application for your business, you&#8217;ll have to make a difficult choice
