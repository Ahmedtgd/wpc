										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today’s modern workplaces are experiencing a metamorphosis, where the days when tasks were solely dependent mainly on human intelligence and labor started to be history in many companies worldwide. With the expansion of AI utilization in different companies, today we are witnessing the rise of a new era — an era of augmented working where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20(AI)%20is%20intelligence,generalize%2C%20and%20to%20infer%20meaning.">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) is reshaping how we function and enhancing productivity in the workplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Advent of Augmented Working</strong></p>
<p>Augmented working refers to the co-existence and collaboration between humans and AI to accomplish tasks more effectively and efficiently, in other words it is the merger of human intellect and AI&#8217;s computational prowess, in order to drive process efficiency and boosts productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This phenomenon is becoming increasingly prevalent as more businesses recognize the potential benefits of AI and incorporate it into their work processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world of AI is vast, with several subsets like Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Robotic Process Automation (RPA), each offering unique capabilities that can augment human skills in different ways, from automating routine tasks to assisting in complex decision-making, AI is changing the landscape of how work is done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AI-Driven Automation and Efficiency</strong></p>
<p>One of the most significant ways AI is augmenting the workplace is through automation. Mundane, repetitive tasks that once consumed a considerable portion of employees&#8217; time can now be automated using AI which in return frees up employees to focus on more critical, value-adding tasks, thereby improving overall productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, AI-powered bots can manage tasks such as email sorting, scheduling meetings, and data entry, which allows employees to focus their attention on tasks that require human intuition, creativity, and strategic thinking, resulting in better use of time and resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, AI-driven automation isn&#8217;t just about taking over repetitive tasks, it also enhances efficiency by reducing the likelihood of errors that can occur when tasks are manually executed, thus leading to more accurate work outcomes and, subsequently, higher-quality products and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AI and Decision Making</strong></p>
<p>AI doesn&#8217;t just help with mundane tasks; it is increasingly being used to assist in complex decision-making processes. For instance, AI algorithms can analyze vast quantities of data quickly and accurately, providing insights that would be challenging and time-consuming for humans to extract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Predictive analytics, a branch of AI, allows businesses to anticipate future trends and make informed decisions, which contribute significantly in improving business strategy, operations and ultimately boosting productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing Collaboration with AI</strong></p>
<p>Beyond individual tasks, AI also enhances collaboration between team members, for instance AI-driven tools can streamline communication, improve the management of tasks, and facilitate the sharing of information. On the other hand, project management tools equipped with AI can optimize work processes by recommending the best way to allocate resources or predicting potential roadblocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, AI can break down geographical barriers by enabling seamless remote collaboration. Tools powered by AI can help teams working in different locations to communicate effectively and work together efficiently, thus accelerating project completion times and enhancing productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Future Outlook</strong></p>
<p>While the current trends in AI are promising, the future holds even more potential. The evolution of AI will continue to redefine the concept of work and augment human capabilities in ways we can only begin to imagine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that this <a href="https://pharaohsoft.com/digital-transformation/">digital transformation</a> comes with its challenges. Ethical considerations, data privacy, and the potential displacement of jobs are issues that need to be addressed. Therefore, businesses need to approach AI integration with care, ensuring they balance the benefits with potential risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, AI is not here to replace humans but to augment human capabilities, making us more efficient and productive. As we embrace this era of augmented working, it&#8217;s crucial to remember that AI is a tool. Its true potential lies not just in the technology itself, but in how we choose to use it to enhance our capabilities and shape our future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By integrating AI into our work processes, we can create workplaces that are not only more productive but also more creative, equitable, inclusive, and sustainable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venturing further into the 21st century, we stand at the precipice of a transformative era shaped by the advent of advanced technologies. These innovations are orchestrating seismic changes within the legal sector, reshaping the operations of law firms, and paving the way for a future where technology and law are inextricably linked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Central to this technological revolution is Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI embodies the essence of machines emulating human intelligence by replicating our capacity for learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding, but does so on an astonishing scale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the capability to process immense amounts of data, discern patterns, and make decisions, AI operates at a pace and accuracy that often outstrips human potential. This powerful tool isn&#8217;t just performing tasks; it&#8217;s defining a new paradigm in legal services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that, coupling AI with digital transformation—a strategic, organization-wide commitment to leveraging digital technologies to improve processes, competencies, and business models—started to revolutionize how law firms around the world conduct their business and most important help decision makers make more informed decisions based on data-driven insights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will delve into how AI and digital transformation are revamping the landscape of legal services, from improving legal research to transforming contract management, and even predicting legal outcomes. Looking into the future, it is quite clear that the integration of AI in law will not only provide practical benefits for law firms but also contribute significantly to shaping the future of the legal sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Pre-AI Era in Legal Services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we explore the profound impact AI has had on the legal sector, it is crucial to understand the landscape of the legal industry in the pre-AI era. Traditionally, the practice of law has been labor-intensive and heavily reliant on human capabilities. Law firms, large and small, primarily depended on the skills and expertise of their attorneys to research case histories, sift through copious amounts of legal documents, draft contracts, and predict possible outcomes of legal cases. While the human touch in these operations was invaluable, it also came with a set of challenges, such as the time-consuming nature of these tasks, high susceptibility to errors, and substantial costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Dawn of AI in Legal Services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI started seeping into the fabric of legal services in several forms, from simple automation tools that handle routine tasks to more complex machine learning models that can analyze extensive legal databases. In essence, AI systems began performing tasks that were once the exclusive domain of human attorneys, but at a speed and efficiency that were previously unimaginable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine learning, a subset of AI that involves the practice of using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make predictions or decisions, is at the forefront of this transformation. These AI systems can analyze legal documents and databases, extract essential details, and draw inferences in a fraction of the time a human attorney would need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that, we must remember that such technological advancements are not by any means replacing lawyers but are empowering them to work more efficiently and focus their expertise on more critical, high-value tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Impacts of AI on Legal Services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on legal services have been profound and far-reaching, ushering in a new era of efficiency and precision. From the ground up, AI has enhanced the way legal research and analysis are conducted. Today&#8217;s sophisticated algorithms have the power to sift through colossal databases of legal documents and case histories, delivering exhaustive research results in an astonishingly brief span. This lightning-fast process doesn&#8217;t just turbocharge the research phase; it also amplifies the precision of the outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below we have thought of sharing some of the AI&#8217;s remarkable impact on the realm of legal services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A. Efficiency in Legal Research and Analysis</strong></p>
<p>AI-powered legal research tools can sift through massive amounts of legal documents, case laws, statutes, and legal opinions at a speed that surpasses human capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, tools like ROSS Intelligence or Westlaw Edge use natural language processing to understand user queries and return relevant legal information, dramatically reducing the time spent on legal research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI-driven analytics can also provide insights on a judge&#8217;s historical rulings or an attorney&#8217;s litigation history, providing lawyers with invaluable strategic advice for their cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B. Improved Contract Management and Review</strong></p>
<p>AI has revolutionized contract management and review processes by automating the identification and extraction of key terms and conditions, as well as assessing risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Platforms like Kira Systems, LawGeex, and Legal Robot can analyze contracts and other legal documents in a fraction of the time it would take a human, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These AI tools can also ensure consistency in contracts by identifying deviations from standard contractual language, reducing potential legal risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>C. Automation of Routine Tasks</strong></p>
<p>AI can automate repetitive and mundane tasks, such as document formatting, legal billing, scheduling, and client intake processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, AI chatbots can handle initial client interactions, gather necessary information, and direct queries to the appropriate legal expert. This automation allows legal professionals to focus more on complex, high-value tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>D. Predictive Analytics for Legal Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>Advanced AI systems can analyze past cases to predict the potential outcomes of legal disputes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tools such as Lex Machina and Premonition use AI to analyze the history of legal cases, providing lawyers with data-driven insights that can help shape their legal strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>E. Enhanced Access to Legal Services</strong></p>
<p>AI can make legal services more accessible by reducing costs and creating platforms where individuals can receive basic legal advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies like DoNotPay and LegalZoom use AI to provide affordable or even free legal services, such as contesting parking tickets or drafting basic legal documents. Despite being free such services can also be used in attracting qualified leads traffic to different law firms website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again we need to stress that AI in the legal industry is not about replacing lawyers with machines, but rather about harnessing the power of technology to augment human capabilities and improve the delivery of legal services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Case Studies</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proof of AI&#8217;s revolutionary impact on legal services is best demonstrated through case studies. Law firms across the globe are increasingly adopting AI and experiencing its benefits first-hand. For instance, global law firm <a href="https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/">Baker McKenzie</a> has implemented AI to automate the process of legal research and documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are two more compelling case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of implementing AI in law firms:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A. Case Study: Latham &amp; Watkins LLP</strong></p>
<p>Latham &amp; Watkins LLP, a prestigious global law firm, offers a prime example of successful AI adoption in legal services. The firm outsourced an AI software development firm specializing in contract analysis and data extraction, to streamline its due diligence process in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before AI implementation, the due diligence process was manually conducted and labor-intensive, involving countless hours of poring over documents to identify potential risks and liabilities. With the new AI system, Latham &amp; Watkins could automate much of the tedious work since it was trained to identify and extract relevant information from contracts and other documents, providing an initial analysis that was more accurate and considerably faster than manual reviews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implementation of the AI system also resulted in significant time savings, increased accuracy, and enhanced the ability to handle larger M&amp;A transactions without compromising on due diligence quality. It also allowed attorneys to focus on higher-value tasks, such as advising clients, instead of getting bogged down in document review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above example showcases how AI can drive operational efficiency in legal firms, enhance service quality, and provide a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B. Case Study: ROSS Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>While not a law firm, ROSS Intelligence provides an excellent example of how AI is reshaping legal research. ROSS is an AI-driven legal research platform that uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) to understand and respond to user queries. Law firms, including the top-ranked ones, have started to incorporate ROSS into their research process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BakerHostetler, a multinational law firm, is one of the early adopters of ROSS. With the implementation of ROSS, the firm’s attorneys could input their research questions in natural language, and the AI tool would return relevant case laws, statutes, and secondary sources. It significantly improved the speed and accuracy of legal research, reducing the hours spent on this task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership with ROSS Intelligence allowed BakerHostetler to provide faster, more efficient services to its clients, while also freeing up their attorneys to focus on strategic areas of their work. This case study illustrates the potential of AI in enhancing the quality and speed of legal research, thus improving client service delivery and satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Future of AI in Legal Services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The future of AI in legal services is teeming with possibilities. Emerging technologies promise to further refine and streamline legal processes, however the widespread adoption of AI also brings along a new set of ethical considerations and potential challenges, such as data privacy concerns and the need for human oversight. Nevertheless, the benefits AI brings to the table way far outweigh these challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, through our experience in implementing these technologies in law firms, we can attest to the <a href="https://pharaohsoft.com/digital-transformation/">transformational power of AI</a> in law firms. Embracing AI and digital transformation is no longer a choice but a necessity for law firms aiming to stay competitive in the digital age.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the perpetually advancing realm of digital technology few innovations have made as significant an impact on businesses as edge computing. This transformative technology has redefined the way businesses and organizations process, analyze, and leverage data, propelling us into a new era of efficiency and connectivity. However, for many, the initial investment into edge computing appears to be a substantial financial hurdle, seemingly costlier than traditional content delivery networks (CDNs) and cloud services. Yet, as we delve deeper, we uncover a different narrative &#8211; one where edge computing, when strategically deployed, can potentially lead to substantial cost reductions and improved performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The foundation of edge computing lies in its unique approach to data processing. It pushes computational tasks away from the conventional centralized data centers to the periphery of the network &#8211; the &#8220;edge&#8221;. By placing computation near the source of data generation, edge computing significantly reduces latency, provides robust connectivity, and enhances user experiences. This shift to the edge also presents an opportunity for businesses to alleviate bandwidth stress on network traffic, further enhancing operational efficiencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first glance, the cost of implementing edge computing may indeed seem daunting, particularly when juxtaposed against the familiar, and often less expensive, upfront costs of CDNs and traditional cloud services. This perception, however, only paints half the picture. When we consider the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), the potential for cost savings through edge computing begins to come into focus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the forthcoming sections, we will unravel the financial intricacies of edge computing, exploring its cost implications in comparison with traditional methods. We will delve into real-world examples of strategic edge computing deployment that have yielded significant cost reductions, and shed light on how such strategies can be replicated across industries. Finally, we will gaze into the crystal ball, examining the future of edge computing, its increasing affordability, and the ways businesses can adapt to and capitalize on these forthcoming changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Embarking on this journey, we invite you to explore the true cost of edge computing, challenging preconceptions, and unveiling its potential as a powerful tool for cost reduction and efficiency enhancement in our digital world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Edge Computing</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>To fully appreciate the cost-saving potential of edge computing, one must first grasp its underlying principles and operational nuances. The crux of edge computing lies in its fundamental shift away from traditional data processing models. Rather than relying on centralized data centers to handle computational tasks, edge computing delegates these responsibilities to the &#8220;edge&#8221; of the network. But what does this mean in more practical terms?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In essence, the &#8220;edge&#8221; refers to devices and technologies located closer to the source of data generation. These could be anything from Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors to local servers and data centers, all acting as processing points within a network. By moving computation closer to where data is produced, edge computing reduces the need to send vast amounts of data over long distances for processing in centralized data centers. This not only minimizes latency but also reduces the bandwidth requirements, improving overall network efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edge computing represents a paradigm shift in the world of data processing, promising enhanced real-time insights and faster response times. It&#8217;s a model designed to cope with the explosive growth of data generated by an increasing array of connected devices and digital services. According to a study from IDC, the total amount of digital data created and consumed globally will rise from 59 zettabytes in 2020 to an estimated 175 zettabytes by 2025. As data volumes continue to skyrocket, edge computing&#8217;s role in managing this data deluge becomes increasingly crucial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, you may wonder why edge computing is often perceived as more expensive than traditional methods. The answer lies partly in the infrastructure required to implement edge computing. Unlike centralized data centers that consolidate resources in a single location, edge computing necessitates the distribution of resources across various points in the network. This requires investment in hardware, software, and network infrastructure capable of supporting edge computing at multiple sites, contributing to higher initial setup costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s essential to note that the cost of edge computing is not solely a matter of infrastructure expenditure. Other factors come into play, such as the cost of data transport, data storage, and system maintenance, among others. It&#8217;s the interplay of these factors that ultimately determines whether edge computing can offer a cost-effective solution for a given scenario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this understanding of what edge computing is and how it works, we can now delve into a more detailed cost analysis and explore how businesses can strategically deploy edge computing to not just match, but potentially outperform traditional models in terms of cost-efficiency and performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cost Analysis: Edge Computing vs. Traditional Methods</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost of deploying edge computing is often contrasted with more traditional methods like content delivery networks (CDNs) and cloud services. At first glance, the initial setup cost of edge computing seems to dwarf these alternatives. This is primarily due to the infrastructure investment required to distribute resources across numerous edge locations. However, to understand the true cost implications of edge computing, we must consider more than just the upfront infrastructure costs. It&#8217;s here that the concept of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) comes into play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TCO includes all costs associated with a particular technology solution throughout its life cycle. For edge computing, this includes the initial setup costs, the cost of data transport, data storage costs, system maintenance and upgrade costs, as well as any costs associated with security and compliance measures. When compared with CDNs and cloud services, the TCO of edge computing might yield a more competitive picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the realm of data transport edge computing offers considerable cost advantages by processing data closer to the source, thus drastically reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent to and from centralized data centers. Which normally can lead to substantial savings in the bandwidth cost especially for businesses dealing with high volumes of data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, data storage costs can also be significantly lowered with edge computing since storing data at the edge can reduce the need of a expensive, centralized storage solutions. While there is certainly a cost associated in equipping edge locations with sufficient storage capacity, this can be offset by the savings on central storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maintenance costs, while potentially higher due to the distributed nature of edge computing, can be mitigated through proper design and the use of modern, self-healing and automated maintenance systems. Innovations in edge computing technologies are continuously reducing the need for manual intervention, further driving down maintenance costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost of security and compliance is a critical consideration. Edge computing expands the attack surface, and ensuring the security of data across multiple edge locations can be a complex task. However, advancements in edge security technologies are helping to mitigate these challenges, and the cost of securing edge computing systems is continually decreasing.</p>
<p>When we compare the TCO of edge computing with traditional methods, it&#8217;s clear that while the upfront costs might be higher, the long-term savings potential is substantial. The key lies in the strategic implementation of edge computing &#8211; an approach that considers not only the immediate financial outlay but also the potential for ongoing operational savings and performance improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Use of Edge Computing</strong></p>
<p>The potential of cost savings through edge computing becomes apparent when considering its strategic deployment. Businesses need to evaluate their use cases, data needs, and operational requirements to determine where and how edge computing can help and deliver the most value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a start it&#8217;s crucial to identify the types of data that would benefit most from edge processing which usually involves data requiring real-time or near-real-time processing, such as IoT devices data, real-time analytics, and latency-sensitive applications. Processing this data at the edge, helps businesses significantly reduce latency, improve their users experiences, and minimize the amount of data that needs to be sent to central data centers for processing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, businesses should consider their storage needs. Edge computing can provide localized data storage, reducing the reliance on expensive, centralized storage solutions. Depending on the type and amount of data being generated, this could lead to substantial cost savings. However, it&#8217;s essential to balance these savings against the need for data accessibility and the potential cost implications of storing data in multiple locations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maintenance and system upgrades are another key consideration. While edge computing systems might require more maintenance due to their distributed nature, advancements in edge technologies are helping to mitigate these challenges. Self-healing systems, automation, and remote management capabilities are reducing the need for manual intervention, lowering maintenance costs, and improving system resilience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Businesses must also consider the cost implications of securing an edge computing system. As edge computing expands the attack surface, ensuring the security of data across multiple edge locations can be a complex task. Having said that the ongoing development of edge security technologies including advanced encryption and threat detection systems, makes it increasingly feasible and affordable to secure these systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By considering these factors and strategically deploying edge computing, businesses can unlock substantial cost savings. Having said that, it is important not be consider Edge computing as a one-size-fits-all solution but rather as a powerful tool that when used strategically can reduce costs and improve performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Increasing Affordability of Edge Computing – An eye towards the future</strong></p>
<p>Looking into the future it&#8217;s quite clear that the cost dynamics of edge computing are set to change dramatically.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that can understand natural language and generate human-like responses to text-based queries. It is one of the most advanced language models available today, capable of processing vast amounts of data and generating responses that are often indistinguishable from those of a human.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The original GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model was first introduced by OpenAI in 2018 and was trained on a large dataset of text from the internet. It used a transformer architecture, which is a type of deep neural network that is particularly effective at processing sequential data, such as text. The model was trained to predict the next word in a sequence of text, which allowed it to learn the underlying structure of natural language and generate coherent text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2019, OpenAI released a more advanced version of the GPT model, called GPT-2, which was trained on an even larger dataset of text and had significantly more parameters than the original model. GPT-2 was capable of generating text that was so convincing that OpenAI decided not to release the full model to the public over concerns that it could be used to generate fake news or other types of disinformation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2020, OpenAI released an even larger version of the GPT model, called GPT-3, which has 175 billion parameters and is currently the largest language model in existence. GPT-3 has demonstrated remarkable language processing capabilities and has been used for a wide range of applications, including language translation, question-answering, and text generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ChatGPT is a variant of the GPT model that has been specifically optimized for generating human-like responses to text-based queries. It has been trained on a large dataset of conversational data and has been fine-tuned on specific tasks, such as customer service or technical support. ChatGPT is capable of generating responses that are tailored to the context of the conversation and can understand natural language queries that are phrased in a wide range of ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, ChatGPT represents a significant evolution in natural language processing and has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries. But how it can revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry, we believe ChatGPT can help the pharmaceutical industry in:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cloud computing has revolutionized the way businesses operate, offering agility, scalability, and cost savings. As organizations migrate their IT infrastructure to the cloud, security has become a major concern. The cloud environment is shipped with unique security challenges, and organizations need to take specific steps to ensure the safety of their data and systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we will explore some of the key strategies organizations can use to ensure the security of their data on the cloud during and post migrating to the cloud</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong><a href="https://pharaohsoft.com/digital-transformation/"><strong>Develop a security strategy</strong></a><br />
A security strategy is a crucial component of any cloud migration plan. It should define the security objectives of the organization, the security measures to be implemented, and the roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders. The security strategy should also identify the potential risks and threats associated with the cloud environment and outline the steps that will be taken to mitigate them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Assess the security of the cloud service provider</strong><br />
The security of the cloud service provider is critical in ensuring the safety of data and systems in the cloud environment. Organizations should conduct a thorough assessment of the cloud service provider&#8217;s security policies, procedures, and practices. The assessment should cover areas such as physical security, network security, access controls, data encryption, and incident response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Choose a secure cloud environment</strong><br />
There are several types of cloud environments, including public, private, and hybrid clouds. Each type of cloud environment has its security advantages and disadvantages. Organizations should choose a cloud environment that meets their security requirements. For instance, public clouds are cost-effective but may not provide the same level of security as private clouds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Secure data in transit</strong><br />
Data in transit refers to data that is moving between two locations. This data is vulnerable to interception and tampering, and organizations need to take measures to secure it. Encryption is a crucial security measure for data in transit. It ensures that data is protected from unauthorized access and tampering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Secure data at rest</strong><br />
Data at rest refers to data that is stored in the cloud environment. This data is vulnerable to theft, data breaches, and other security threats. Organizations should implement security measures such as access controls, data encryption, and backups to secure data at rest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. Implement access controls</strong><br />
Access controls are critical in ensuring that only authorized users can access data and systems in the cloud environment. Organizations should implement access controls such as user authentication, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control. These measures ensure that only authorized users can access data and systems in the cloud environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. Monitor the cloud environment</strong><br />
Monitoring the cloud environment is critical in identifying and responding to security incidents. Organizations should implement tools and processes to monitor the cloud environment for suspicious activity, unauthorized access, and other security threats. These tools should also provide real-time alerts to enable organizations to respond promptly to security incidents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8. Conduct regular security audits</strong><br />
Regular security audits are critical in identifying security gaps and vulnerabilities in the cloud environment. Organizations should conduct regular security audits to assess the effectiveness of their security measures and identify areas for improvement. These audits should cover areas such as access controls, data encryption, incident response, and compliance with security standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9. Train your employees on security best practices</strong><br />
Employees are often the weakest link in an organization&#8217;s security posture. Organizations should train employees on security best practices such as password management, phishing awareness, and social engineering awareness. These measures ensure that employees are aware of the security risks and take appropriate measures to protect data and systems in the cloud environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10. Ensure compliance with security standards</strong><br />
Compliance with security standards such as the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is critical in ensuring the safety of data and systems in the cloud environment. Organizations should ensure that they comply with these standards and implement the necessary security measures to meet the requirements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Virtualization is a process that enables you to build a virtual version of a desktop, operating system, network resources, or server. This technique allows you to run multiple desktop operating systems and applications on the same hardware and software at the same time, as well as virtual emulation of goods or services on the same computer, without compromising the system&#8217;s efficiency.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
</br></p>
<div>Virtualization was first introduced in the 1960s to maximize hardware resources by constructing a virtual layer on top of a host or computer, with the introduction of cloud companies, virtualization became of great importance to those companies as it enabled them to deliver a diverse variety of services, operating systems, and other virtual machines while maximizing data centers.</div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p></br></p>
<div>In cloud computing, virtualization facilitates the development of virtual computers and guarantees the seamless operation of numerous operating systems. It also contributes to the formation of a virtual ecosystem for server operating systems and multiple storage devices.</div>
<div>
<div>Scalability, efficiency, and economic value are all advantages of cloud computing, while providing simplified workload management methods. Simply said, Cloud Computing in conjunction with Virtualization provides the contemporary organization with a more cost-effective solution to operate several operating systems on a single devoted resource.</div>
<div></div>
<p></br></p>
<div>Virtualization technology has five different types:</div>
<div><strong>Applications Virtualization</strong></div>
<div>This is accomplished via the use of a server, where this server contains all of the personal information and other characteristics necessary to utilize the applications. The server is available through the internet and operates on a local workstation. An end user may execute two separate versions of the same application using application virtualization.</div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p></br></p>
<div><strong>Data Virtualization</strong></div>
<div>This is a sort of virtualization in which data is obtained and collected from several sources and controlled from a single place. There is no technical understanding as to where such data is obtained, gathered, kept, or structured. The data is logically organized, and interested parties and stakeholders may then access the virtual view of such data. These reports can also be viewed remotely by end users.</div>
<div></div>
<p></br></p>
<div><strong>Storage Virtualization</strong></div>
<div>This sort of Virtualization offers virtual storage systems that ease storage management. It enables efficient storage management by allowing access to numerous sources from a single repository. Storage virtualization ensures smooth and constant performance.</div>
<div></div>
<p></br></p>
<div><strong>Servers Virtualization</strong></div>
<div>This kind of virtualization guarantees server masking. The primary or intended server is partitioned into several virtual servers. To help the masking procedure, such servers continually change their identifying numbers and processors. This means that each server may run its own operating system completely independently.</div>
<div></div>
<p></br></p>
<div><strong>Desktops Virtualization</strong></div>
<div>This is the form of virtualization that allows end-user operating systems to be remotely stored on a server or data center. It allows users to remotely access their PCs while sitting in any geographical place. They may also access their computers remotely by using separate devices.</div>
<div>With desktop virtualization, an end-user may operate on many operating systems based on their business requirements. If the person wants to operate on an operating system other than Windows, he may use desktop virtualization. This allows the user to work on two separate operating systems.</div>
<div></div>
<p></br></p>
<div><strong>But what are the real benefits of virtualization?</strong></div>
<div>Virtualization has various advantages, including cost savings and increased efficiency in the development process. It also eliminates the need for a very complicated IT infrastructure and enables remote access to resources while also promoting quicker scalability.</div>
<div></div>
<p></br></p>
<div>Having said that, virtualization is very adaptable, allowing users to run several desktop operating systems on a single conventional computer, eliminating the dangers associated with system breakdowns while also enhancing flexible data movement across multiple virtual servers.</div>
<div></div>
<p></br></p>
<div>The only drawback we can mention here about virtualization is really minor because the transfer from a current hardware arrangement to a virtualized system needs a significant time commitment, and this might be considered a time-consuming procedure.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There are billions of smartphone users around the world, and most of the time that they’re on their phones, they’re using an app. Many already leverage this opportunity to bring profit to their businesses, which is why about 100,000 apps are released every month. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If you are in the early stages of developing an app, your first question is likely, “How much does it cost?” In this article, we’re going to answer all of your questions about mobile app costs, budgets, timelines, and more. Let’s get started.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>Average Mobile App Cost<br />
</i></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In 2022, the cost of making an app varies widely. It can be as little as $10,000 or as much as $500,000 depending on your process, the features you want to include, your goals for mobile app development time, and the professionals you work with. </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>Features that Increase Mobile App Cost<br />
</i></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">While in the brainstorming phase, consider which features your audience needs, which they want, and which you can leave out. Take a look at this list of common features and decide whether you will offer each to your audience. From there, you can get an idea of mobile app cost.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Adapting to Tablets: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Developing apps to be used on smartphones </span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>and</i></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> tablets can increase your budget by as much as 150%. To be successful on a tablet, the app must adapt to larger screens and be optimized for user experience.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Multiple Viewing Modes:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> If you want users to have the option to use the app in portrait and landscape, that can increase your mobile app cost by 30%. Landscape mode shows more information on the screen at one time, but most apps don’t need this feature and offer only portrait mode.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Supporting Older Devices: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There is a wide range of devices still in use both for iOS and <a href="https://play.google.com/store">Android</a>. Supporting older smartphones and tablets means that you can reach a wider audience. However, it can increase your budget up to 200%.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Offline Mode: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Cache algorithms are required for apps to function without data or a WiFi connection. This can be pricey, especially if you want your app to sync on multiple devices. Add $8,000 to $12,000 onto your final mobile app cost to offer this feature.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Notifications: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Notifications are a great way to encourage engagement. However, even the most basic set can cost you between $1,500 and $2,500. Custom ones will cost you even more — as much as $5,000.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>User Profiles: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A good majority of apps require some sort of profile that the user will have to log into. For social media apps, this feature costs about $500. </span></span><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">For more secure logins (e.g., banking), the app needs authorizations and other features that add up to nearly $2,000.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Multilingual Options: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If you have an international audience, you will need to support the languages of those areas. This feature typically costs less than $500.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>User-to-User Chat:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> A chat feature between users can be very expensive. It’s practically an app in and of itself. So, expect to pay anywhere from $2,500 for off-the-shelf solutions to $12,000 for custom coding for this feature.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Ads. </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ads allow you to make some extra income, but there is a bit of an upfront cost. To integrate ads into your app, expect to increase your mobile app cost by about $1,600 to $2,000.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Analytics and Usage Information:</b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Understanding how your users interact with your app is always useful when trying to improve your offerings. You can track information like how many users are on the app, how many make payments, where those users were sourced, and more. The more you want to know, the more you will have to budget. Even basic tracking can cost as much as $2,000.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">These are only a few of the features you may consider integrating, but they are some of the most common. It should give you a rough ballpark of your mobile app cost.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>Miscellaneous Mobile App Costs</i></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Now that we’ve covered some of the features that may increase your budget, let’s look at some of the app development costs that you may not have considered. These are significant components of your budget:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Back-End Development: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If your app stores data online, syncs with the cloud or has a chat feature, you’ll need a server. Note: if you have an existing server, there’s no added cost here. Otherwise, it can increase your mobile app cost by $6,800 to $28,000.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Legal Paperwork: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Protect your intellectual property with patents. A patent for an app can cost between $2,000 and $6,000. Also, create Terms of Service and Privacy Policy documents for your users to review and sign. You can find boilerplate versions of these documents online for free.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Marketing: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Don’t forget the cost of marketing your app to gain users. It doesn’t do much good to put in all the work if you don’t have users, so add about $10,000 to your mobile app cost for marketing around the time that the app is released.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>Breaking Down the Cost by App Development Phase</i></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A great way to help you stay on track with your budget is to plan how much will go to each phase. Every time you finish a phase, check to see how well you stuck to your budget and make changes, if necessary. Here are the phases you need to plan for throughout your mobile app development time:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Planning and Analysis: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In this phase, you perform a market analysis and decide which features will be in your app. This will use about 10% of your budget. Don’t try to cut corners in this phase, even if you’re trying to cut back costs or mobile app development time. This will act as the foundation for the rest of the development process.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Developing a Prototype: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Develop a prototype that you can click through to get an idea of the user experience. At this point, you will also incorporate your brand design. This phase is another 10% to 15% of your budget.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Coding: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This is the largest portion of your mobile app development time, and it’s where the most work happens. Coding is the most expensive and will eat up 60% to 70% of your budget. Use this budget to hire, at the very least, three team members. If you have it in the budget, hire five or six team members for the best results.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Project Management: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The remaining 10% to 15% of your budget goes to project management. To keep everything running smoothly, you need a project manager who can check in on deadlines, navigate around any major roadblocks, and keep the entire process on track so that you meet your mobile app development time goals.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>Developing an App on a Small Budget</i></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If the cost of developing an app is beginning to feel overwhelming, there are some things you can do to create your app on a smaller budget. Here are some tips to help you cut corners without compromising quality:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Speed up the Process with Cross-Platform Development: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If you offer your app for iOS and Android devices, develop the two apps side-by-side to save time and money. It can decrease your mobile app cost by 10% to 30%.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Start with a Bare Bones App: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Release the minimum viable product (MVP) with only the required features. This bare-bones version of your app will give you a sort of test run to see whether your audience is interested in what you’re offering (before you shell out six figures to build the full app).</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Work with Teams that Develop and Design: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Sometimes, apps are passed back and forth between a development team and a design team. By working with an agency that offers both services, you decrease your mobile app development time and cost.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Consider Software Development Kits: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">When you can, use software development kits (SDKs) as an off-the-shelf alternative to custom features. It saves time and money, and SDKs often come with official support services to answer any questions.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Support Only the Latest Devices: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Remember in the features section where we mentioned that supporting old or outdated devices can increase your budget twice over? You could simply choose to launch the app on only the latest devices instead. You will have a smaller audience reach, but it could significantly cut back your mobile app cost.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>How Long Does It Take to Develop an App?</i></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Understanding <a href="https://pharaohsoft.com/custom-mobile-app-development-services/">mobile app development</a> time is a key part of planning your budget. If you’re creating an MVP, you may only need a couple of weeks. Simple apps take a bit longer — about a month. For apps that have more advanced features, plan for two or three months. As you can see, mobile app development time depends on the features your app will include (and the size of your development team).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Conclusion</b></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There are a lot of things that go into determining the cost of developing an app. If the cost range we mentioned at the beginning of the article ($10,000 &#8211; $500,000) seemed ridiculous, I’m sure you can now understand why the range is so wide.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">While you’re in the planning and analysis stage, be very mindful in selecting what needs to be included in your app and what doesn’t. Take your time in the early phases and set a good foundation. It’s the only way to accurately estimate your costs, create a reasonable budget, and set realistic expectations for mobile app development time.</span></span></p>
