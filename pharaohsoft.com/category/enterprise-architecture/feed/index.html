										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology increasingly influences everyday life and the way we handle business. It is always evolving, creating more efficient processes, offering new capabilities, and opening doors to new ways to do business.</p>
<p>This technical growth is great, allowing our society to advance in ways we never thought possible before. However, it does also create an issue for businesses known as technical debt. This debt is the amount of resources that a business will need to invest in the future to update its products, services, and systems.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll talk about what exactly technical debt is, how a business can accrue it quickly, and how you can reach technical equity.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Debt Definition?</strong></p>
<p>Technical debt refers to the cost needed to bring all of your business&#8217;s technology up-to-date. When you’re running with the most efficient, cutting edge technology, software, <a href="https://pharaohsoft.com/custom-mobile-app-development-services/">apps</a>, etc., you reach technical equity.</p>
<p>Like any debt, technical debt has a principal cost and a cost of interest. The principal cost refers to the amount that you would need to spend to update all of the technology in your business to reach technical equity. It’s a large amount. But if you can’t afford it, you continue to pay the technical debt interest. In this scenario, interest refers to the time and money that you spend trying to make workarounds that allow you to continue business with sub-par technology.</p>
<p>When you continue to put off the principal cost, you pay more and more in interest, and the cost increases the longer this goes on. As your equipment and software become more and more outdated, the cost grows because the workarounds become more complex. Eventually, you can fall so far behind that your technology is no longer sufficient, and you must update your tech or become obsolete.</p>
<p>In the time that you continue to put off updates, the financial resources that could have gone to the principal are all wasted on the interest.</p>
<p>Not only are you slowly draining your resources, but the future financial investments in your tech are stunted. For instance, if you spend $100 (for simplicity’s sake) on a new IT project, but half of your budget has to go to adapting your old tech to the new process, you really are only able to invest $50 in this new venture.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you consistently maintain technical equity, you won’t get caught in the cycle of draining financial resources on interest. You will also be able to fully focus your IT project budget on the new offering itself, which translates to more innovative products and services.</p>
<p><strong>How Do Businesses Accrue Technical Debt?</strong></p>
<p>Technical debt is unavoidable because the tech industry grows and evolves so quickly. So first, accept that you will face tech debt and that you need a plan of action to address it. Beyond that, here are some reasons that you may accrue technical debt quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unnecessary complexity or redundancy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Can your products, processes, or applications be simplified? Can they be more standardized? Are multiple apps working to complete an action that one app could do? Review your tech and see if there are ways to make things more streamlined and efficient with fewer components.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No dedicated technical debt team</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Often, managing technical debt is deprioritized in an effort to deliver new offerings quicker. Because the teams dedicated to new offerings are on tight deadlines, they focus on getting their project finished on time and do not take steps to limit the additional tech debt they may cause or to address tech debt that they encounter.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the issue of technical debt keeps getting pushed back further and further because there are no resources specifically dedicated to it. By creating a team that solely manages tech debt, the issue will no longer be pushed back for “someone else” to deal with.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unclear expectations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Tech debt can accrue quickly without clear funding strategies, business strategies, or capability requirements. Expectations need to be explicit to ensure that initiatives are managed well with low technical debt accrual.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rigid software</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Highly customized software can quickly result in tech debt accumulation. Because coding is heavily tailored to your specific needs, it’s a lot of work to go back in and create workarounds for the future. Similarly, large blocks of code can be difficult to reuse or revise.</p>
<p>When you don’t plan for flexibility in your software, it can make updates more time-consuming, more expensive, and all-around less convenient.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No plan for the backlog</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Recovering from accessive tech debt can be tough because you need to address new issues while also working through a backlog of updates that should have already been made. In order to work on these simultaneously, there needs to be some sort of prioritization strategy so that the most pressing needs are addressed first. Use a task-management tool to help keep your business on track and create accountability.</p>
<p>These are just some reasons that tech debt may be accruing quickly within your business, but there are many different potential causes. The best way to get ahead of tech debt is to first be aware of the major ways in which it’s adding up within your business. If you are aware of it, you can begin to work on it earlier and prevent a significant build-up.</p>
<p><strong>How to Recover from Technical Debt</strong></p>
<p>If you have a large amount of tech debt, there are a few things that you can do to right the ship:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define technical debt</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Start by establishing a company-wide definition of tech debt. Because tech debt has such a significant impact on the business overall, it cannot be pigeonholed into a tech department issue.</p>
<p>Of course, tech debt can be defined by the actual financial costs that go into creating workarounds with outdated equipment, software, etc. However, it can also include staffing required to create workarounds, a slower go-to-market timeframe, decreased flexibility, and more.</p>
<p>Before you can really address technical debt, you have to have a specific definition that is shared and agreed upon within the organization.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actively monitor principal and interest costs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To help keep an eye on resources that are being drained by tech debt, create a tracking system that allows executives and other leaders to see its impact. Put these costs on <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plstatement.asp">P&amp;L statements</a> so that each department can see how they are affected by tech debt.</p>
<p>This is useful for two reasons. First, it can be easy to underestimate the impact that tech debt has on your business, especially for non-IT departments. By creating a space where everyone can see the impact, leaders can fully understand how this issue impacts their department.</p>
<p>Second, when everyone is on the same page about the impact of tech debt, it’s much easier to create a united front dedicated to achieving technical equity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be honest about the usefulness of your tech</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t become overly attached to “business as usual.” Businesses that dig in their heels in the presence of technological change are not the businesses that grow and thrive.</p>
<p>Take a moment to honestly evaluate the equipment, software, apps, and other technology used for your business — both back-office and customer-facing. What definitely needs to be updated? What is doing okay for now, but may need to change in the future? What is draining your time and financial resources more than it is benefitting your business?</p>
<p>Once you have a thorough understanding of what you’re working with, it’s much easier to create a plan of action that addresses the most draining needs first.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dedicate a set amount of resources to manage technical debt</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Achieving and maintaining technical equity is significantly easier with budgeted resources. At this point, you have defined tech debt in your business, monitored the costs, and established which areas most need attention. With a budget in place, you can begin to systematically recover from technical debt.</p>
<p>Dedicating resources goes beyond funding; it also includes <a href="https://www.pharaohsoft.com/staff-augmentation/">staffing</a>. Create an interdepartmental team that focuses specifically on managing tech debt. They can regularly review the usefulness of your tech, discuss where resources are being drained, and allocate resources to updates.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make small updates regularly</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Making small updates regularly is the best way to maintain technical equity without interrupting the day-to-day workings of the business. If you wait until the eleventh hour and make huge updates all at once, you expose yourself to a lot of risks, potentially disrupt business until the update is completed, and you spend a lot of resources on interest along the way.</p>
<p>When you choose smaller and more regular updates, you can be more strategic, predictable, and efficient for the long haul.</p>
<p>Technical debt is unavoidable, and it has the power to completely bury your business. It can slow down production, create unnecessary costs, and take a huge bite out of your IT project budgets. However, with the proper awareness, designated resources, and a solid maintenance strategy, you can keep that debt from accumulating and interrupting your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you plan for a new software development project, there are two popular ways to approach it that you have likely heard about — Agile and Waterfall. Though there are some similarities between the two, there are also some key differences. So, how do you know which approach is best for you?</p>
<p>To help you decide on Agile vs. Waterfall methodology, this article will answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does Agile mean?</li>
<li>What does Waterfall mean?</li>
<li>What are the pros and cons of each strategy?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Does Agile Mean?</strong></p>
<p>To begin comparing Agile vs. Waterfall methodology, we must first answer the question, “What does Agile mean?”</p>
<p>Agile is a project management strategy based on the principles outlined in a published paper written by William Royce in the 70s on large software system development. Agile is composed of short development cycles called “sprints” that last around one to four weeks each.</p>
<p>At the end of each sprint, the development team checks in with the client, delivering what has been completed so far. These check-ins create an opportunity to receive regular client feedback throughout the development process, creating an iterative and customer-centric approach to software development.</p>
<p>These methods include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In this phase, the product manager and key stakeholders work closely with the client to gather requirements, prioritize design elements, find resources to meet requirements and create user stories that contain deliverable portions of the final product and required features.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the design phase, experts on user interface and experience meet with the client to make decisions on the visual design of the product, creating sketches and mockups that can be used to inform the development phase.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Develop</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In this phase, the scrum master and development team begin the first sprint to deliver a set of user stories representing specific features of the final product.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>During this phase, the deliverable presented to the client is tested against the client’s definition of completion. Does it fit the user story set earlier by the scrum master and product owner?</p>
<p>If there are defects or if changes need to be made, new user stories are created and worked into the next sprint. This cycle continues until the deliverable is complete and includes all required product features.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deploy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Once perfected, the final product is marked as complete and shipped to the customer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evaluate</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that the project is complete, the project team looks back on the development process, documenting lessons learned to help improve future team performance.</p>
<p>When answering, “What does agile mean?” the answer is less about these methods and more about the way you use them. Using Agile, a team shares the product or service progress with the customer, creating opportunities for frequent check-ins. These are referred to as “sprints.” At the end of each sprint, the customer can update requirements to ensure that the product or service fits their needs.</p>
<p><strong>What Does Waterfall Mean?</strong></p>
<p>Now that we’ve answered “What does agile mean?” we must define the Waterfall methodology. Waterfall is a more direct development methodology that follows an exact set of steps in a specific order. Where Agile allows for more cycles, check-ins, and reiterations, Waterfall is a linear, beginning-to-end process.</p>
<p>The individual steps in this methodology are very similar:</p>
<p><strong>1. Gather Requirements</strong></p>
<p>In this first phase, the development team gathers and analyzes product information including functional, system, and technical specifications.</p>
<p><strong>2. Design</strong></p>
<p>Based on the information you learned in the requirements-gathering phase, begin designing prototypes that will meet the customer’s requirements. In this step, the design includes the functionality of the product or service as well as its appearance.</p>
<p><strong>3. Development</strong></p>
<p>In this phase, the team develops the product based on the requirements gathered and the design requirements supplied by the design team.</p>
<p><strong>4. Test</strong></p>
<p>Once the development phase is complete, the team performs end-to-end, system, and performance tests to ensure that the product meets the client requirements established in phase one. If there are any issues, they are addressed before delivering the product to the customer.</p>
<p><strong>5. Deliver</strong></p>
<p>Once the final product passes all tests against client requirements and specifications, it is delivered.</p>
<p><strong>6. Maintain</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the client, some may request additional features or may change the scope of the project. This can result in extra costs and extended deadlines depending on the change and its effect on the final product.</p>
<p>While some of the steps in Agile vs. Waterfall methodology look very similar, the difference lies in how the steps are executed. With the Agile principle, steps are more cyclical. The process creates opportunities for rapid changes, translating to lower costs when changes are requested by the client. You may return to past steps or repeat steps, checking in with the customer each time to ensure they are satisfied with how development is progressing. This happens in small cycles so that the team doesn’t have to rebuild or restructure the application.</p>
<p>The Waterfall methodology is more structured and linear. You follow a distinct set of processes and procedures, focusing more on meeting the original requirements than making changes with the customer along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Pros and Cons</strong></p>
<p>So far, we’ve answered “What does Agile mean?” and “What does Waterfall mean?” Next, we will compare the pros and cons of the two so that you can decide on Agile vs. Waterfall methodology for your next project.</p>
<p><strong>Agile</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced risk of an unsatisfactory end product</li>
<li>Allows for more creativity and adventurous design because the customer reviews and updates requirements regularly</li>
<li>Increased flexibility and better communication for the customer</li>
<li>Higher accountability and collaboration on the development team</li>
<li>There should be less to rework since issues are dealt with while they’re still in the early stages of development</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not the most intuitive process, and it takes time to learn how to do it well</li>
<li>The process may be unpredictable</li>
<li>It takes a lot of effort and commitment from the team and the customer to check-in so regularly</li>
<li>Because it’s hard to predict what the final product or service will look like, it can be harder to get commitments from stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Waterfall</strong></p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Teams are better able to predict what the final product or service will look like</li>
<li>It’s more practical for large-scale projects</li>
<li>It is more intuitive and easier than Agile for teams of all sizes</li>
<li>Creates more stability for development teams that don’t have as much experience</li>
<li>It’s easier to establish a fixed budget and set timeline because you can predict what the end product or service looks like</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Customers don’t always know exactly what they need at the beginning of the project, so setting requirements requires some guesswork</li>
<li>When requirements must be fully defined up-front, there’s a risk that the end product or service may not completely meet the customer’s needs</li>
<li>Changes are made later in the development process. By that time, a small change that was easy to change has become a deeply embedded issue that will be costly to fix</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>When you’re choosing Agile vs. Waterfall methodology, remember that Agile is more customer-centered and allows for more flexibility in the design process while Waterfall is more structured and predictable for development teams with less experience.</p>
<p>We hope that this article has answered some of your questions about these two strategies so that you can make an informed decision for your next project.</p>
