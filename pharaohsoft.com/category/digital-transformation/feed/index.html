										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today’s modern workplaces are experiencing a metamorphosis, where the days when tasks were solely dependent mainly on human intelligence and labor started to be history in many companies worldwide. With the expansion of AI utilization in different companies, today we are witnessing the rise of a new era — an era of augmented working where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20(AI)%20is%20intelligence,generalize%2C%20and%20to%20infer%20meaning.">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) is reshaping how we function and enhancing productivity in the workplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Advent of Augmented Working</strong></p>
<p>Augmented working refers to the co-existence and collaboration between humans and AI to accomplish tasks more effectively and efficiently, in other words it is the merger of human intellect and AI&#8217;s computational prowess, in order to drive process efficiency and boosts productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This phenomenon is becoming increasingly prevalent as more businesses recognize the potential benefits of AI and incorporate it into their work processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world of AI is vast, with several subsets like Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Robotic Process Automation (RPA), each offering unique capabilities that can augment human skills in different ways, from automating routine tasks to assisting in complex decision-making, AI is changing the landscape of how work is done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AI-Driven Automation and Efficiency</strong></p>
<p>One of the most significant ways AI is augmenting the workplace is through automation. Mundane, repetitive tasks that once consumed a considerable portion of employees&#8217; time can now be automated using AI which in return frees up employees to focus on more critical, value-adding tasks, thereby improving overall productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, AI-powered bots can manage tasks such as email sorting, scheduling meetings, and data entry, which allows employees to focus their attention on tasks that require human intuition, creativity, and strategic thinking, resulting in better use of time and resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, AI-driven automation isn&#8217;t just about taking over repetitive tasks, it also enhances efficiency by reducing the likelihood of errors that can occur when tasks are manually executed, thus leading to more accurate work outcomes and, subsequently, higher-quality products and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AI and Decision Making</strong></p>
<p>AI doesn&#8217;t just help with mundane tasks; it is increasingly being used to assist in complex decision-making processes. For instance, AI algorithms can analyze vast quantities of data quickly and accurately, providing insights that would be challenging and time-consuming for humans to extract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Predictive analytics, a branch of AI, allows businesses to anticipate future trends and make informed decisions, which contribute significantly in improving business strategy, operations and ultimately boosting productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing Collaboration with AI</strong></p>
<p>Beyond individual tasks, AI also enhances collaboration between team members, for instance AI-driven tools can streamline communication, improve the management of tasks, and facilitate the sharing of information. On the other hand, project management tools equipped with AI can optimize work processes by recommending the best way to allocate resources or predicting potential roadblocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, AI can break down geographical barriers by enabling seamless remote collaboration. Tools powered by AI can help teams working in different locations to communicate effectively and work together efficiently, thus accelerating project completion times and enhancing productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Future Outlook</strong></p>
<p>While the current trends in AI are promising, the future holds even more potential. The evolution of AI will continue to redefine the concept of work and augment human capabilities in ways we can only begin to imagine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that this <a href="https://pharaohsoft.com/digital-transformation/">digital transformation</a> comes with its challenges. Ethical considerations, data privacy, and the potential displacement of jobs are issues that need to be addressed. Therefore, businesses need to approach AI integration with care, ensuring they balance the benefits with potential risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, AI is not here to replace humans but to augment human capabilities, making us more efficient and productive. As we embrace this era of augmented working, it&#8217;s crucial to remember that AI is a tool. Its true potential lies not just in the technology itself, but in how we choose to use it to enhance our capabilities and shape our future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By integrating AI into our work processes, we can create workplaces that are not only more productive but also more creative, equitable, inclusive, and sustainable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venturing further into the 21st century, we stand at the precipice of a transformative era shaped by the advent of advanced technologies. These innovations are orchestrating seismic changes within the legal sector, reshaping the operations of law firms, and paving the way for a future where technology and law are inextricably linked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Central to this technological revolution is Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI embodies the essence of machines emulating human intelligence by replicating our capacity for learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding, but does so on an astonishing scale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the capability to process immense amounts of data, discern patterns, and make decisions, AI operates at a pace and accuracy that often outstrips human potential. This powerful tool isn&#8217;t just performing tasks; it&#8217;s defining a new paradigm in legal services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that, coupling AI with digital transformation—a strategic, organization-wide commitment to leveraging digital technologies to improve processes, competencies, and business models—started to revolutionize how law firms around the world conduct their business and most important help decision makers make more informed decisions based on data-driven insights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will delve into how AI and digital transformation are revamping the landscape of legal services, from improving legal research to transforming contract management, and even predicting legal outcomes. Looking into the future, it is quite clear that the integration of AI in law will not only provide practical benefits for law firms but also contribute significantly to shaping the future of the legal sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Pre-AI Era in Legal Services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we explore the profound impact AI has had on the legal sector, it is crucial to understand the landscape of the legal industry in the pre-AI era. Traditionally, the practice of law has been labor-intensive and heavily reliant on human capabilities. Law firms, large and small, primarily depended on the skills and expertise of their attorneys to research case histories, sift through copious amounts of legal documents, draft contracts, and predict possible outcomes of legal cases. While the human touch in these operations was invaluable, it also came with a set of challenges, such as the time-consuming nature of these tasks, high susceptibility to errors, and substantial costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Dawn of AI in Legal Services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI started seeping into the fabric of legal services in several forms, from simple automation tools that handle routine tasks to more complex machine learning models that can analyze extensive legal databases. In essence, AI systems began performing tasks that were once the exclusive domain of human attorneys, but at a speed and efficiency that were previously unimaginable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine learning, a subset of AI that involves the practice of using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make predictions or decisions, is at the forefront of this transformation. These AI systems can analyze legal documents and databases, extract essential details, and draw inferences in a fraction of the time a human attorney would need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that, we must remember that such technological advancements are not by any means replacing lawyers but are empowering them to work more efficiently and focus their expertise on more critical, high-value tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Impacts of AI on Legal Services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on legal services have been profound and far-reaching, ushering in a new era of efficiency and precision. From the ground up, AI has enhanced the way legal research and analysis are conducted. Today&#8217;s sophisticated algorithms have the power to sift through colossal databases of legal documents and case histories, delivering exhaustive research results in an astonishingly brief span. This lightning-fast process doesn&#8217;t just turbocharge the research phase; it also amplifies the precision of the outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below we have thought of sharing some of the AI&#8217;s remarkable impact on the realm of legal services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A. Efficiency in Legal Research and Analysis</strong></p>
<p>AI-powered legal research tools can sift through massive amounts of legal documents, case laws, statutes, and legal opinions at a speed that surpasses human capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, tools like ROSS Intelligence or Westlaw Edge use natural language processing to understand user queries and return relevant legal information, dramatically reducing the time spent on legal research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI-driven analytics can also provide insights on a judge&#8217;s historical rulings or an attorney&#8217;s litigation history, providing lawyers with invaluable strategic advice for their cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B. Improved Contract Management and Review</strong></p>
<p>AI has revolutionized contract management and review processes by automating the identification and extraction of key terms and conditions, as well as assessing risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Platforms like Kira Systems, LawGeex, and Legal Robot can analyze contracts and other legal documents in a fraction of the time it would take a human, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These AI tools can also ensure consistency in contracts by identifying deviations from standard contractual language, reducing potential legal risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>C. Automation of Routine Tasks</strong></p>
<p>AI can automate repetitive and mundane tasks, such as document formatting, legal billing, scheduling, and client intake processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, AI chatbots can handle initial client interactions, gather necessary information, and direct queries to the appropriate legal expert. This automation allows legal professionals to focus more on complex, high-value tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>D. Predictive Analytics for Legal Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>Advanced AI systems can analyze past cases to predict the potential outcomes of legal disputes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tools such as Lex Machina and Premonition use AI to analyze the history of legal cases, providing lawyers with data-driven insights that can help shape their legal strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>E. Enhanced Access to Legal Services</strong></p>
<p>AI can make legal services more accessible by reducing costs and creating platforms where individuals can receive basic legal advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies like DoNotPay and LegalZoom use AI to provide affordable or even free legal services, such as contesting parking tickets or drafting basic legal documents. Despite being free such services can also be used in attracting qualified leads traffic to different law firms website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again we need to stress that AI in the legal industry is not about replacing lawyers with machines, but rather about harnessing the power of technology to augment human capabilities and improve the delivery of legal services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Case Studies</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proof of AI&#8217;s revolutionary impact on legal services is best demonstrated through case studies. Law firms across the globe are increasingly adopting AI and experiencing its benefits first-hand. For instance, global law firm <a href="https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/">Baker McKenzie</a> has implemented AI to automate the process of legal research and documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are two more compelling case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of implementing AI in law firms:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A. Case Study: Latham &amp; Watkins LLP</strong></p>
<p>Latham &amp; Watkins LLP, a prestigious global law firm, offers a prime example of successful AI adoption in legal services. The firm outsourced an AI software development firm specializing in contract analysis and data extraction, to streamline its due diligence process in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before AI implementation, the due diligence process was manually conducted and labor-intensive, involving countless hours of poring over documents to identify potential risks and liabilities. With the new AI system, Latham &amp; Watkins could automate much of the tedious work since it was trained to identify and extract relevant information from contracts and other documents, providing an initial analysis that was more accurate and considerably faster than manual reviews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implementation of the AI system also resulted in significant time savings, increased accuracy, and enhanced the ability to handle larger M&amp;A transactions without compromising on due diligence quality. It also allowed attorneys to focus on higher-value tasks, such as advising clients, instead of getting bogged down in document review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above example showcases how AI can drive operational efficiency in legal firms, enhance service quality, and provide a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B. Case Study: ROSS Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>While not a law firm, ROSS Intelligence provides an excellent example of how AI is reshaping legal research. ROSS is an AI-driven legal research platform that uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) to understand and respond to user queries. Law firms, including the top-ranked ones, have started to incorporate ROSS into their research process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BakerHostetler, a multinational law firm, is one of the early adopters of ROSS. With the implementation of ROSS, the firm’s attorneys could input their research questions in natural language, and the AI tool would return relevant case laws, statutes, and secondary sources. It significantly improved the speed and accuracy of legal research, reducing the hours spent on this task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership with ROSS Intelligence allowed BakerHostetler to provide faster, more efficient services to its clients, while also freeing up their attorneys to focus on strategic areas of their work. This case study illustrates the potential of AI in enhancing the quality and speed of legal research, thus improving client service delivery and satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Future of AI in Legal Services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The future of AI in legal services is teeming with possibilities. Emerging technologies promise to further refine and streamline legal processes, however the widespread adoption of AI also brings along a new set of ethical considerations and potential challenges, such as data privacy concerns and the need for human oversight. Nevertheless, the benefits AI brings to the table way far outweigh these challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, through our experience in implementing these technologies in law firms, we can attest to the <a href="https://pharaohsoft.com/digital-transformation/">transformational power of AI</a> in law firms. Embracing AI and digital transformation is no longer a choice but a necessity for law firms aiming to stay competitive in the digital age.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the perpetually advancing realm of digital technology few innovations have made as significant an impact on businesses as edge computing. This transformative technology has redefined the way businesses and organizations process, analyze, and leverage data, propelling us into a new era of efficiency and connectivity. However, for many, the initial investment into edge computing appears to be a substantial financial hurdle, seemingly costlier than traditional content delivery networks (CDNs) and cloud services. Yet, as we delve deeper, we uncover a different narrative &#8211; one where edge computing, when strategically deployed, can potentially lead to substantial cost reductions and improved performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The foundation of edge computing lies in its unique approach to data processing. It pushes computational tasks away from the conventional centralized data centers to the periphery of the network &#8211; the &#8220;edge&#8221;. By placing computation near the source of data generation, edge computing significantly reduces latency, provides robust connectivity, and enhances user experiences. This shift to the edge also presents an opportunity for businesses to alleviate bandwidth stress on network traffic, further enhancing operational efficiencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first glance, the cost of implementing edge computing may indeed seem daunting, particularly when juxtaposed against the familiar, and often less expensive, upfront costs of CDNs and traditional cloud services. This perception, however, only paints half the picture. When we consider the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), the potential for cost savings through edge computing begins to come into focus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the forthcoming sections, we will unravel the financial intricacies of edge computing, exploring its cost implications in comparison with traditional methods. We will delve into real-world examples of strategic edge computing deployment that have yielded significant cost reductions, and shed light on how such strategies can be replicated across industries. Finally, we will gaze into the crystal ball, examining the future of edge computing, its increasing affordability, and the ways businesses can adapt to and capitalize on these forthcoming changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Embarking on this journey, we invite you to explore the true cost of edge computing, challenging preconceptions, and unveiling its potential as a powerful tool for cost reduction and efficiency enhancement in our digital world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Edge Computing</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>To fully appreciate the cost-saving potential of edge computing, one must first grasp its underlying principles and operational nuances. The crux of edge computing lies in its fundamental shift away from traditional data processing models. Rather than relying on centralized data centers to handle computational tasks, edge computing delegates these responsibilities to the &#8220;edge&#8221; of the network. But what does this mean in more practical terms?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In essence, the &#8220;edge&#8221; refers to devices and technologies located closer to the source of data generation. These could be anything from Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors to local servers and data centers, all acting as processing points within a network. By moving computation closer to where data is produced, edge computing reduces the need to send vast amounts of data over long distances for processing in centralized data centers. This not only minimizes latency but also reduces the bandwidth requirements, improving overall network efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edge computing represents a paradigm shift in the world of data processing, promising enhanced real-time insights and faster response times. It&#8217;s a model designed to cope with the explosive growth of data generated by an increasing array of connected devices and digital services. According to a study from IDC, the total amount of digital data created and consumed globally will rise from 59 zettabytes in 2020 to an estimated 175 zettabytes by 2025. As data volumes continue to skyrocket, edge computing&#8217;s role in managing this data deluge becomes increasingly crucial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, you may wonder why edge computing is often perceived as more expensive than traditional methods. The answer lies partly in the infrastructure required to implement edge computing. Unlike centralized data centers that consolidate resources in a single location, edge computing necessitates the distribution of resources across various points in the network. This requires investment in hardware, software, and network infrastructure capable of supporting edge computing at multiple sites, contributing to higher initial setup costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s essential to note that the cost of edge computing is not solely a matter of infrastructure expenditure. Other factors come into play, such as the cost of data transport, data storage, and system maintenance, among others. It&#8217;s the interplay of these factors that ultimately determines whether edge computing can offer a cost-effective solution for a given scenario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this understanding of what edge computing is and how it works, we can now delve into a more detailed cost analysis and explore how businesses can strategically deploy edge computing to not just match, but potentially outperform traditional models in terms of cost-efficiency and performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cost Analysis: Edge Computing vs. Traditional Methods</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost of deploying edge computing is often contrasted with more traditional methods like content delivery networks (CDNs) and cloud services. At first glance, the initial setup cost of edge computing seems to dwarf these alternatives. This is primarily due to the infrastructure investment required to distribute resources across numerous edge locations. However, to understand the true cost implications of edge computing, we must consider more than just the upfront infrastructure costs. It&#8217;s here that the concept of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) comes into play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TCO includes all costs associated with a particular technology solution throughout its life cycle. For edge computing, this includes the initial setup costs, the cost of data transport, data storage costs, system maintenance and upgrade costs, as well as any costs associated with security and compliance measures. When compared with CDNs and cloud services, the TCO of edge computing might yield a more competitive picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the realm of data transport edge computing offers considerable cost advantages by processing data closer to the source, thus drastically reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent to and from centralized data centers. Which normally can lead to substantial savings in the bandwidth cost especially for businesses dealing with high volumes of data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, data storage costs can also be significantly lowered with edge computing since storing data at the edge can reduce the need of a expensive, centralized storage solutions. While there is certainly a cost associated in equipping edge locations with sufficient storage capacity, this can be offset by the savings on central storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maintenance costs, while potentially higher due to the distributed nature of edge computing, can be mitigated through proper design and the use of modern, self-healing and automated maintenance systems. Innovations in edge computing technologies are continuously reducing the need for manual intervention, further driving down maintenance costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost of security and compliance is a critical consideration. Edge computing expands the attack surface, and ensuring the security of data across multiple edge locations can be a complex task. However, advancements in edge security technologies are helping to mitigate these challenges, and the cost of securing edge computing systems is continually decreasing.</p>
<p>When we compare the TCO of edge computing with traditional methods, it&#8217;s clear that while the upfront costs might be higher, the long-term savings potential is substantial. The key lies in the strategic implementation of edge computing &#8211; an approach that considers not only the immediate financial outlay but also the potential for ongoing operational savings and performance improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Use of Edge Computing</strong></p>
<p>The potential of cost savings through edge computing becomes apparent when considering its strategic deployment. Businesses need to evaluate their use cases, data needs, and operational requirements to determine where and how edge computing can help and deliver the most value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a start it&#8217;s crucial to identify the types of data that would benefit most from edge processing which usually involves data requiring real-time or near-real-time processing, such as IoT devices data, real-time analytics, and latency-sensitive applications. Processing this data at the edge, helps businesses significantly reduce latency, improve their users experiences, and minimize the amount of data that needs to be sent to central data centers for processing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, businesses should consider their storage needs. Edge computing can provide localized data storage, reducing the reliance on expensive, centralized storage solutions. Depending on the type and amount of data being generated, this could lead to substantial cost savings. However, it&#8217;s essential to balance these savings against the need for data accessibility and the potential cost implications of storing data in multiple locations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maintenance and system upgrades are another key consideration. While edge computing systems might require more maintenance due to their distributed nature, advancements in edge technologies are helping to mitigate these challenges. Self-healing systems, automation, and remote management capabilities are reducing the need for manual intervention, lowering maintenance costs, and improving system resilience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Businesses must also consider the cost implications of securing an edge computing system. As edge computing expands the attack surface, ensuring the security of data across multiple edge locations can be a complex task. Having said that the ongoing development of edge security technologies including advanced encryption and threat detection systems, makes it increasingly feasible and affordable to secure these systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By considering these factors and strategically deploying edge computing, businesses can unlock substantial cost savings. Having said that, it is important not be consider Edge computing as a one-size-fits-all solution but rather as a powerful tool that when used strategically can reduce costs and improve performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Increasing Affordability of Edge Computing – An eye towards the future</strong></p>
<p>Looking into the future it&#8217;s quite clear that the cost dynamics of edge computing are set to change dramatically.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once you&#8217;ve decided to develop a mobile application for your business, you&#8217;ll have to make a difficult choice between recruiting an in-house development team or explore the option of outsourcing a mobile app development company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s best to weigh all of the pro&#8217;s and cons of in-house and outsourcing mobile app development teams before making a decision as your decision can have a significant impact on your mobile app total cost of ownership. In this article we will help you get a better understanding of both options, the particularly outsourcing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In-house development vs. outsourcing mobile app development services</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In-house Development Team</strong></p>
<p>An in-house development team provides several distinct advantages, from having  Y our own team that understands your business thoroughly and out, with all of its quirks, and up to having a complete control over the app development process since the team will be working right in your office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are certain disadvantages to consider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The total cost of ownership (TCO) for a mobile app built using your in-house team is quite high since you&#8217;ll need to hire experienced developers, provide them with office space and equipment, and pay all other expenditures connected with in-house team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another disadvantage to consider is that your new in-house development team will most probably have limited knowledge and experience with your business domain, which will result in additional cost of training and time until they are fully acquainted with your business domain, business process,..etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must not overlook the importance of a business analyst to analyse your business requirements, convert them I coordination with the team lead into deliverable tasks your in-house developers can deliver. Also an infosec expert will be required to ensure the security of your app including most important your customers&#8217; information who will be using your app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, you need to carefully study if you will need the whole team after releasing your app or you will need to reduce the maintenance team size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, an in-house team is unquestionably the best option when you have a large mobile application project, such as Whatsapp, Alibaba or Booking.com, which will undoubtedly need a big team in-house team for development and maintenance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Outsourcing mobile app development choices:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three choices for outsourcing mobile app development, and we will explore each of them in detail, including the advantages and disadvantages of each:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mobile app development tools</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re building a small app, short on time and money and don&#8217;t need anything unique in term of UI/UX and features then you might consider mobile app development tools like Xamarin, Appcelerator,&#8230;etc. One of the major advantages of those tools is their overall cost, which will help you get your mobile app in front of your clients quickly at the lowest budget possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you should also study the disadvantages of those tools, to see if they weigh higher when making your decision. By using mobile app development tools,  it will be quite challenging to scale your mobile app in the future or to move your app from those tools to another technology stack, which might result in getting you to rebuild your app again from scratch on another technology stack in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to UI/UX, mobile app development tools, have some great UI/UX to offer for your app, yet that won&#8217;t be unique as many others using the same tool have used the same UI before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Independent mobile app developers</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Outsourcing your mobile app development to independent developers on various freelancing platforms is another viable option for a simple app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freelancers are usually specialized in one or two niches in which they excel. If the features you want are within the app developer&#8217;s area of expertise, you could save a lot of money. Some freelancers also collaborate with others, forming teams similar to those seen at outsourcing firms. You may not need to look for separate developers, designers, and QA professionals in this situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One disadvantage of hiring freelancers to complete your next mobile application project is that there is little you can do to prevent the freelancers from dropping the ball mid-project. The damage associated with such risk does not end at hiring a new freelancer or the time wasted in finding another freelancer with an experience in your business domain, as the next selected freelancer will have learning curve to understand the previous freelancer&#8217;s source code before resuming your project which will come at an extra cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mobile app development companies</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you have an unique idea, business process, or a medium-large mobile application and time is of importance, it is best to outsource your mobile application project to a company with expertise in your business domain. Android, iOS developers, UI/UX designers, testers, project managers, and business analysts are all available via bespoke mobile application development companies. When building a mobile application from scratch, a complete team is unquestionably the best option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can ensure the security of your mobile application idea with a legally binding agreement, establish penalties for late deliveries, and have a single point of contact to track the development of your project without having to worry about training, absence, leave, dropping the ball..etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The actual disadvantage of engaging with bespoke mobile app development companies is their cost, which is obviously more than that of independant contractors and mobile app development tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of option you select, you need to carefully consider each alternative before continuing to prevent increasing the total cost of ownership for your mobile application or, worse, endangering the security of your mobile application concept or corporate secrets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology increasingly influences everyday life and the way we handle business. It is always evolving, creating more efficient processes, offering new capabilities, and opening doors to new ways to do business.</p>
<p>This technical growth is great, allowing our society to advance in ways we never thought possible before. However, it does also create an issue for businesses known as technical debt. This debt is the amount of resources that a business will need to invest in the future to update its products, services, and systems.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll talk about what exactly technical debt is, how a business can accrue it quickly, and how you can reach technical equity.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Debt Definition?</strong></p>
<p>Technical debt refers to the cost needed to bring all of your business&#8217;s technology up-to-date. When you’re running with the most efficient, cutting edge technology, software, <a href="https://pharaohsoft.com/custom-mobile-app-development-services/">apps</a>, etc., you reach technical equity.</p>
<p>Like any debt, technical debt has a principal cost and a cost of interest. The principal cost refers to the amount that you would need to spend to update all of the technology in your business to reach technical equity. It’s a large amount. But if you can’t afford it, you continue to pay the technical debt interest. In this scenario, interest refers to the time and money that you spend trying to make workarounds that allow you to continue business with sub-par technology.</p>
<p>When you continue to put off the principal cost, you pay more and more in interest, and the cost increases the longer this goes on. As your equipment and software become more and more outdated, the cost grows because the workarounds become more complex. Eventually, you can fall so far behind that your technology is no longer sufficient, and you must update your tech or become obsolete.</p>
<p>In the time that you continue to put off updates, the financial resources that could have gone to the principal are all wasted on the interest.</p>
<p>Not only are you slowly draining your resources, but the future financial investments in your tech are stunted. For instance, if you spend $100 (for simplicity’s sake) on a new IT project, but half of your budget has to go to adapting your old tech to the new process, you really are only able to invest $50 in this new venture.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you consistently maintain technical equity, you won’t get caught in the cycle of draining financial resources on interest. You will also be able to fully focus your IT project budget on the new offering itself, which translates to more innovative products and services.</p>
<p><strong>How Do Businesses Accrue Technical Debt?</strong></p>
<p>Technical debt is unavoidable because the tech industry grows and evolves so quickly. So first, accept that you will face tech debt and that you need a plan of action to address it. Beyond that, here are some reasons that you may accrue technical debt quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unnecessary complexity or redundancy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Can your products, processes, or applications be simplified? Can they be more standardized? Are multiple apps working to complete an action that one app could do? Review your tech and see if there are ways to make things more streamlined and efficient with fewer components.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No dedicated technical debt team</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Often, managing technical debt is deprioritized in an effort to deliver new offerings quicker. Because the teams dedicated to new offerings are on tight deadlines, they focus on getting their project finished on time and do not take steps to limit the additional tech debt they may cause or to address tech debt that they encounter.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the issue of technical debt keeps getting pushed back further and further because there are no resources specifically dedicated to it. By creating a team that solely manages tech debt, the issue will no longer be pushed back for “someone else” to deal with.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unclear expectations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Tech debt can accrue quickly without clear funding strategies, business strategies, or capability requirements. Expectations need to be explicit to ensure that initiatives are managed well with low technical debt accrual.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rigid software</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Highly customized software can quickly result in tech debt accumulation. Because coding is heavily tailored to your specific needs, it’s a lot of work to go back in and create workarounds for the future. Similarly, large blocks of code can be difficult to reuse or revise.</p>
<p>When you don’t plan for flexibility in your software, it can make updates more time-consuming, more expensive, and all-around less convenient.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No plan for the backlog</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Recovering from accessive tech debt can be tough because you need to address new issues while also working through a backlog of updates that should have already been made. In order to work on these simultaneously, there needs to be some sort of prioritization strategy so that the most pressing needs are addressed first. Use a task-management tool to help keep your business on track and create accountability.</p>
<p>These are just some reasons that tech debt may be accruing quickly within your business, but there are many different potential causes. The best way to get ahead of tech debt is to first be aware of the major ways in which it’s adding up within your business. If you are aware of it, you can begin to work on it earlier and prevent a significant build-up.</p>
<p><strong>How to Recover from Technical Debt</strong></p>
<p>If you have a large amount of tech debt, there are a few things that you can do to right the ship:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define technical debt</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Start by establishing a company-wide definition of tech debt. Because tech debt has such a significant impact on the business overall, it cannot be pigeonholed into a tech department issue.</p>
<p>Of course, tech debt can be defined by the actual financial costs that go into creating workarounds with outdated equipment, software, etc. However, it can also include staffing required to create workarounds, a slower go-to-market timeframe, decreased flexibility, and more.</p>
<p>Before you can really address technical debt, you have to have a specific definition that is shared and agreed upon within the organization.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actively monitor principal and interest costs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To help keep an eye on resources that are being drained by tech debt, create a tracking system that allows executives and other leaders to see its impact. Put these costs on <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plstatement.asp">P&amp;L statements</a> so that each department can see how they are affected by tech debt.</p>
<p>This is useful for two reasons. First, it can be easy to underestimate the impact that tech debt has on your business, especially for non-IT departments. By creating a space where everyone can see the impact, leaders can fully understand how this issue impacts their department.</p>
<p>Second, when everyone is on the same page about the impact of tech debt, it’s much easier to create a united front dedicated to achieving technical equity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be honest about the usefulness of your tech</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t become overly attached to “business as usual.” Businesses that dig in their heels in the presence of technological change are not the businesses that grow and thrive.</p>
<p>Take a moment to honestly evaluate the equipment, software, apps, and other technology used for your business — both back-office and customer-facing. What definitely needs to be updated? What is doing okay for now, but may need to change in the future? What is draining your time and financial resources more than it is benefitting your business?</p>
<p>Once you have a thorough understanding of what you’re working with, it’s much easier to create a plan of action that addresses the most draining needs first.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dedicate a set amount of resources to manage technical debt</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Achieving and maintaining technical equity is significantly easier with budgeted resources. At this point, you have defined tech debt in your business, monitored the costs, and established which areas most need attention. With a budget in place, you can begin to systematically recover from technical debt.</p>
<p>Dedicating resources goes beyond funding; it also includes <a href="https://www.pharaohsoft.com/staff-augmentation/">staffing</a>. Create an interdepartmental team that focuses specifically on managing tech debt. They can regularly review the usefulness of your tech, discuss where resources are being drained, and allocate resources to updates.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make small updates regularly</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Making small updates regularly is the best way to maintain technical equity without interrupting the day-to-day workings of the business. If you wait until the eleventh hour and make huge updates all at once, you expose yourself to a lot of risks, potentially disrupt business until the update is completed, and you spend a lot of resources on interest along the way.</p>
<p>When you choose smaller and more regular updates, you can be more strategic, predictable, and efficient for the long haul.</p>
<p>Technical debt is unavoidable, and it has the power to completely bury your business. It can slow down production, create unnecessary costs, and take a huge bite out of your IT project budgets. However, with the proper awareness, designated resources, and a solid maintenance strategy, you can keep that debt from accumulating and interrupting your business.</p>
